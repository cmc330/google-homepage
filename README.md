This is my attempt at the first real project from The Odin Project. The Assignment is to reconstruct the basic Google search page using HTML and CSS.
There are serveral things that this should help me to learn and to cement the information that I already learned following the Odin Project to this point.
These include:
	1. Setting up a Github repository for the project. I am completly new to Git and Github and this will be good practice to learn and remember the process of using Git in a normal work flow for future projcets.
	2. Structuring a basic web page with HTML.
	3. Styling a web page using CSS.  The project did not specify but I will attemt to use a seperate style sheet to learn and get used to importing files to my HTML file and will organize directories to the best of my knowledge for industry standards.
